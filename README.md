# Fysetc Voron 2.4 R2 Pro

When I built my first Voron, I was told that I should buy a LDO kit.  I do not recall if I was given specific reasons, but I do recall hearing things like, it was one of the most complete kits out there, you didn't have to terminate any cables, etc.

So I purchased and built my Voron.  Then months later, other people were asking me about building a Voron.  Just like those before me, I recommended the LDO kit.  It was then shown to me the Fysetc kit.  This kit seemed just as complete as the LDO, and included some upgraded items like TAP that I have since added on mine.

My response was simple.  I do not have any personal experience with that kit, but there must be a reason that everyone recommended to me the LDO kit.  We've all heard the old saying, "You get what you pay for".  But does it really have to be that expensive?

Well now that I have built LDO kits for V2.4, Trident and Switchwire, and have added some upgrades, I figured perhaps I need to personally look into this Fysetc kit to see is this something for a first time Voron builder to get them started into the wonderful world of Voron without the high entry price tag of a LDO kit?  Is this kit "good enough"?  Well with it being about 2/3 the cost of the LDO, and Fysetc having a sale, I purchased one to find out if this is beginner friendly enough for most.

I hope to use this as kind of a running note board for what I find along the way.

# The package

So when the kit arrived (and rather quickly I might add), it was in two boxes.  It appears that one contains the panels, heat bed, and build plate items.  The other is the only one I have opened so far.

So I don't do "unboxings", and normally don't take pictures of how an item is packaged, but I have to say I was impressed in how this was packaged.
